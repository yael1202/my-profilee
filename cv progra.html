        <h2>Cars 🚗🏎</h2>
        <p>
          I am passionate by cars, especially supercars, luxury cars but I know a lot about normal cars too. I can’t say that I know all the models and brands of the world, but most of them 🙃!
          My favorite brand in the category of supercars is Bugatti, and it’s important to mention that it's a French brand 🇫🇷🤑

        <p>

          As you may have understood my astrological sign is Aquarius, with an ascendant and a Libra sign, I let you imagine the person I am... I am the person that everyone can count on, the person who has only one vocation in life: to help others, often despite his own interests.
